# Agent workflow

Before any of the workflows below, the human prepares the matching harness
instructions so the agent starts with the correct mode contract:

```bash
booktx agents write . --mode isolated --profile PROFILE   # then cd translations/<profile>
booktx agents write . --mode collaborative                 # stay at the project root
```

The agent then starts in the matching directory and runs `booktx mode .` and
`booktx doctor isolation .` to confirm the mode. The generated `AGENTS.md` is
the local entry contract; it does not replace the installed booktx skill.

## 1. Choose the access mode

### Collaborative translation workflow

Start at the project root when you need profile selection or cross-profile
review:

```bash
booktx status .
booktx profile list .
```

If multiple profiles exist, pass `--profile` on all translation-state commands.

Before starting isolated translation, run the generic source-policy interview when source analysis is available:

```bash
booktx source analyze BOOK --write --sync-profiles
booktx source interview-plan BOOK --profile PROFILE --write
booktx source interview-next BOOK --profile PROFILE --format markdown
booktx source interview-status BOOK --profile PROFILE --fail-if-open
```

Persist only user-approved answers with `booktx source interview-answer BOOK CAND-... --profile PROFILE --target TARGET --write`, or record explicit skips with `booktx source interview-skip`.

### Isolated evaluation workflow

Start inside `translations/<profile>/` when you want unbiased model or context
evaluation for one profile:

```bash
booktx mode .
booktx doctor isolation .
booktx source status .
booktx context status .
```

In isolated mode, use only profile-local `booktx ... .` commands. Never use
parent paths, absolute paths, shell globs, interpreter snippets, or sibling
profile commands. If booktx prints a sibling profile or a parent path, stop and
report a booktx isolation bug.

## 2. Read the profile-local context

```text
context.md
```

Do not start translating when `context.json` is missing or not ready.

## 3. Request a task

```bash
booktx translate next . --unit batch --max-words 800 --format block
```

This writes:

- `tasks/TASK.source.block.txt`
- `ingest/TASK.block.txt`
- `ingest/TASK.json`

The task JSON also records the dotted baseline version plus the immutable
context-view snapshot used for that task.

## 4. Fill the durable ingest file

Translate only the record bodies. Keep record ids and placeholders unchanged.

## 5. Submit the result

```bash
booktx translate insert . \
  --task-id TASK \
  --file ingest/TASK.block.txt \
  --format block
```

## 6. Validate and build

```bash
booktx validate . --fail-on-warnings
booktx build . --require-complete
```

For per-batch validation within a bounded todo, use scoped `booktx check . --chapter CHAPTER --fail-on-warnings` instead. Use `booktx validate` only for the final pre-build check.

## 6b. Refresh editor QA indexes

After translation/review changes, refresh the three editor-friendly indexes for source-only search, target-only search, and side-by-side review:

```bash
booktx translate export-index .
```

This writes `source-index.json`, `target-index.json`, and `source-target-index.json` into the profile directory. Use `rg` to search translated terms without English source false positives (`rg "Wespen" target-index.json`) or source terms without target matches (`rg "Wasp" source-index.json`). Use `nvim source-target-index.json` for side-by-side scanning.

The three files are generated artifacts. Do not edit them manually and do not use them as build input.

## 7. Longer bounded runs

When the user asks to continue for multiple chapters, do not request one huge
chapter task. Create a todo instead:

```bash
booktx translate todo-next . --profile PROFILE_A --chapters 3 --batch-words 800 --write
booktx translate todo-status . --profile PROFILE_A --latest
booktx translate todo-resume . --profile PROFILE_A --latest --format block
```

Read the generated todo markdown and follow its loop. After each completed
chapter, fill the `booktx context chapter-note` template printed by
`booktx translate insert`; do not hand-edit `context.md` for chapter notes.

If validation flags an old accepted record during a bounded run, use
`booktx translation revise-record . RECORD_ID --target "..."` to fix it.
Never edit `translation-store.json` directly.
That chapter-note append affects the next task's context view, but it does not
mint a new dotted version by itself.
Stop when the todo goal is complete, when `todo-status` says it is complete, or
when a stop condition occurs. Report partial progress if conversation or tool
budget runs low. `--max-run-words` is advisory only.

## Guardrails

- Never mix files between profiles.
- Cross-profile reference work is allowed only from project-root collaborative
  mode.
- Use `booktx context sync` for same-book sibling policy propagation instead of
  copying context files or hand-repeating glossary decisions.
- Never edit `.booktx/chunks/*.json` directly during normal translation work.
- Never edit `translations/<profile>/translation-store.json` directly. If validation flags an old accepted record, use `booktx translation revise-record` to fix it.
- Never edit `translations/<profile>/translated/*.json` directly; use `booktx translate export`.
- Use `booktx profile compare` for cross-profile review instead of mixing store files manually.
- Use project-root mode to create or refresh a judge source snapshot. After
  `booktx judge sync-sources` or `booktx judge prepare-isolation`, a selection
  profile may run `booktx judge status/next/record/insert` from its profile root
  without sibling profile access.
- If a `todo-status`, `todo-resume`, or `todo-next` command fails with an internal
  booktx error, stop and report the tool failure. Do not silently switch to a
  large unbounded `translate next --unit chapter` task. Bounded todos exist to
  keep agent runs within budget; bypassing them defeats that purpose.
  Only use `translate next --unit chapter` for small chapters or when the user
  explicitly requests a whole-chapter task.

## Finish a single large chapter

If the user asks to finish a chapter and that chapter has more than the safe
task budget, booktx automatically creates a single-chapter todo and returns
bounded batch tasks. Do not create a giant chapter task:

```bash
booktx translate next . --chapter 0005 --unit chapter --max-words 800 --format block
# booktx auto-creates a single-chapter todo and returns a bounded batch
booktx translate insert . --task-id TASK --file ingest/TASK.block.txt --format block
booktx check . --chapter 0005 --fail-on-warnings
booktx translate todo-resume . --latest --format block
# repeat until chapter complete
```

Only use `--force-chapter` for small chapters or when explicitly requested.

After each chapter, always run `booktx check` before adding the chapter note:

```bash
booktx check . --chapter 0005 --fail-on-warnings
booktx context chapter-note . 0005 --title "ONE" ...
```

## Context approval hard stop

Stop and ask the user whenever context questions are open or only recommended. Do not translate from a context that you generated yourself. Prepare a user review form, then wait for explicit approval or edited answers before running `booktx context approve` and `booktx context mark-ready`.

## EPUB inline XHTML translation rule

For EPUB records, preserve inline XHTML tags and attributes in the target. Translate text nodes only. Do not convert `<em>` or other inline tags to Markdown markers.

## 7b. Quality review pass workflow

After validation passes, optional quality review improves the accepted target:

1. `booktx review status .` -- check which records still need review per pass
2. `booktx review next . --pass 1` -- create a review task for un-reviewed records
3. Edit the prefilled ingest block under `translations/<profile>/reviews/`
4. `booktx review insert . --review-task-id TASK --file reviews/TASK.block.txt`
5. Repeat for pass 2: `booktx review next . --pass 2`, review, insert
6. Validate and build: `booktx validate . --fail-on-warnings && booktx build . --require-complete --require-reviewed`

During review pass tasks, review the existing target critically. Preserve meaning,
placeholders, protected terms, and inline XHTML. If the current target is already
good, submit it unchanged -- booktx stores an explicit review candidate either way.

## Judge / selection workflow

When the user wants to assemble a best-of profile from several sibling
translations, stay at the project root and use the dedicated judge workflow:

```bash
booktx judge create-profile ./book JUDGE_PROFILE \
  --target de \
  --target-locale de-DE \
  --sources PROFILE_A,PROFILE_B \
  --context-from PROFILE_A \
  --model gpt-5.5 \

booktx judge accept-identical ./book \
  --profile JUDGE_PROFILE \
  --sources PROFILE_A,PROFILE_B \
  --unit chapter \
  --chapter 0001 \
  --max-records 100 \
  --write

booktx judge next ./book \
  --profile JUDGE_PROFILE \
  --sources PROFILE_A,PROFILE_B \
  --unit chapter \
  --chapter 0001 \
  --max-records 8 \
  --format decisions
```

Judge tasks expose the original source plus each source profile's effective
candidate. Prefer exact candidate copy when one option is already correct.
For `decision_kind: copy`, set `selected` and `reason` and leave `TARGET`
empty so booktx copies the selected candidate exactly. Choose
`decision_kind: edited` only when every available candidate needs a repair.
Submit the completed judge ingest file with `booktx judge insert ...`;
store and records provenance in `translation-selection-ledger.json`.

In `selection.purpose=compare` (the default, shown above), prefer
`accept-identical` and `sweep-identical` for true multi-source identical
candidates.

In `selection.purpose=revise`, never use deterministic selection commands.
Create the profile with `--purpose revise` and exactly one source; every
record requires an explicit copy or edited judge decision. Later corrections
must use `booktx judge record . --record RECORD_ID`, not translation or
review revision commands, because revision output is valid only while each
active target has matching judge-decision provenance. See _Single-source judge
revision profiles_ in `docs/profiles.md`.

## Isolated judge workflow

After the selection profile context is ready, prepare a profile-local snapshot
of the source candidate stores:

```bash
booktx judge prepare-isolation ./book --profile JUDGE_PROFILE --write
```

This copies source `translation-store.json`, `translation-version-ledger.json`,
`identity.json`, and `profile-config.json` into an immutable
`judge-sources/snapshots/<SNAPSHOT_ID>/` directory and writes judge-specific
`AGENTS.md` instructions. Then start the judge agent inside the profile root:

```bash
cd translations/JUDGE_PROFILE

# profile root
booktx judge status .
booktx judge accept-identical . --unit chapter --chapter 0001 --max-records 100 --write
booktx judge next . --unit chapter --chapter 0001 --max-records 8 --format decisions
booktx judge insert . --judge-task-id TASK --file judge-ingest/TASK.decisions.txt --format decisions
booktx judge reset-ingest . --judge-task-id TASK --format decisions --write
booktx judge continue . --max-records 8
```

The isolated judge workflow uses copied candidate data and never reads sibling
profiles. Output is sanitized: no `--profile` flag, no parent paths, and no
`translations/<profile>` references. Submission paths are confined to regular
files inside the current profile. Do not chain `judge insert` and `judge next`
in one shell command; continue only after a successful insert.
